SQL Injection:
A web application vulnerability that interferes with the queries an application makes to its database. By injecting malicious scripts into input fields or URLs, attackers can manipulate the database, access unauthorized data, or even modify or delete information

Normal Query (Expected Behavior):
A user inputs data (e.g., username and password).
The application uses this input to form a query:
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'user123' AND password = 'pass123';
The database checks for a matching user and password.

SQL Injection (Exploited Behavior):
An attacker inputs malicious SQL code instead of normal input.
Example input for the username field:

' OR '1'='1


Resulting query:
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1' AND password = 'pass123';


Since '1'='1' is always true, the attacker bypasses authentication.

Retrieving hidden data
Imagine a shopping application that displays products in different categories. When the user clicks on the Gifts category, their browser requests the URL:
https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts
This causes the application to make a SQL query to retrieve details of the relevant products from the database:
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1
This SQL query asks the database to return:
all details (*)
from the products table
where the category is Gifts
and released is 1.
The restriction released = 1 is being used to hide products that are not released. We could assume for unreleased products, released = 0.

Using -- to bypass a password check is an example of SQL Injection, a vulnerability that occurs when user input is directly included in SQL queries without proper validation or escaping. Let me explain how you can use -- to manipulate a query to bypass the password check, step by step:

Understanding the Query Structure
Suppose the application performs a SQL query like this when you log in:

sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'wiener' AND password = 'bluecheese';
The username and password inputs are directly embedded in the query.
For login to succeed, the query must find a row in the users table where both conditions (username = 'wiener' and password = 'bluecheese') are true.
Injecting Malicious Input
Target the username field:

By including an SQL comment sequence (--), you can "terminate" the rest of the query.
Input the following in the username field:
vbnet
Copy code
administrator'--
Leave the password field blank or enter anything (it won't be checked).
Resulting Query: When the application processes your input, the query becomes:

sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator'--' AND password = '';
How This Works:

The part of the query after -- is treated as a comment and ignored by the database.
The effective query becomes:
sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator';
The password condition is removed from the query.
Outcome:

If the users table contains a row where username = 'administrator', the query will return that row.
The application assumes the login is successful because a valid user was found, even though the password wasn't verified.

Step-by-Step Exploit
Hereâ€™s how you might execute this attack:

Input the following into the login form:

Username: administrator'--
Password: (leave blank or input anything)
Observe the Application's Behavior:

If the application doesn't properly validate inputs or escape special characters, it sends the modified query to the database.
The application logs you in as the administrator user, bypassing the password check.
Mitigating SQL Injection
To prevent this attack, web developers should:

Use parameterized queries (prepared statements): Ensure user input is treated as data, not executable code. Example (using Python and SQLite):
python
Copy code
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?", (username, password))
Escape input properly: Sanitize input to escape characters like ', ", or --.
Validate input: Restrict inputs to expected formats (e.g., alphanumeric usernames).
Employ least privilege: Ensure the database user used by the app has minimal permissions.
By securing the application, such SQL Injection attacks can be avoided.
