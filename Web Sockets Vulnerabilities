What Are WebSockets?
WebSockets are a communication protocol widely used in modern web applications to enable real-time,
two-way communication between a client (usually a browser) and a server.
Unlike regular HTTP, where each request requires a separate connection,
WebSockets maintain a persistent connection that allows asynchronous data exchange in both directions without needing to re-establish the connection.

How WebSockets Work
Initiation via HTTP:

A WebSocket connection starts as an HTTP request using the Upgrade header.
The server responds, upgrading the connection from HTTP to WebSocket.
Example of a WebSocket handshake:
http
Copy code
Client Request:
GET /chat HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Upgrade: websocket
Connection: Upgrade

Server Response:
HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols
Upgrade: websocket
Connection: Upgrade
Persistent Connection:

Once established, the WebSocket connection remains open, allowing the client and server to send messages back and forth at any time.
This eliminates the overhead of repeatedly establishing new HTTP connections.
Bidirectional Communication:

Data can flow from the client to the server or vice versa without needing a new request.

1. Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH)
Description:

This occurs when a malicious site tricks a user’s browser into opening a WebSocket connection to a legitimate server using the user’s session cookies or authentication tokens.
If the server does not validate the origin of the WebSocket request, the attacker can send unauthorized WebSocket messages.
Impact:

Unauthorized actions, such as accessing sensitive data or executing privileged commands.
Mitigation:

Use the Origin header to validate requests.
Require authentication (e.g., tokens) for WebSocket connections.
2. Lack of Encryption
Description:

If WebSocket communications use ws:// instead of wss:// (WebSocket Secure), the data is transmitted in plaintext, making it susceptible to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.
Impact:

Attackers can intercept and manipulate sensitive data, such as credentials or personal information.
Mitigation:

Always use secure WebSocket connections (wss://).
Employ TLS certificates to encrypt communications.
3. Injection Attacks
Description:

Similar to traditional HTTP, poorly sanitized input in WebSocket messages can lead to SQL injection, command injection, or cross-site scripting (XSS).
Impact:

Data breaches, database corruption, or exploitation of client-side vulnerabilities.
Mitigation:

Validate and sanitize all WebSocket input data.
Use parameterized queries and avoid directly executing user input.
4. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Description:

If the client-side WebSocket implementation processes untrusted data, an attacker could inject malicious scripts that execute in the user’s browser.
Impact:

Stealing cookies or session tokens, manipulating the DOM, or spreading malware.
Mitigation:

Sanitize and escape all data displayed on the client side.
Use Content Security Policies (CSP) to mitigate script execution.
5. Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks
Description:

WebSocket connections are persistent, consuming server resources for each open connection.
An attacker can overwhelm the server by opening a large number of WebSocket connections, causing resource exhaustion.
Impact:

Service unavailability for legitimate users.
Mitigation:

Implement rate limiting and connection quotas per IP address or user.
Use Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) to detect and block abnormal connection patterns.
6. Authentication and Authorization Flaws
Description:

Some WebSocket implementations fail to properly authenticate or authorize users after the connection is established.
Attackers may exploit these flaws to access restricted data or execute privileged actions.
Impact:

Data breaches or unauthorized actions.
Mitigation:

Authenticate users before establishing WebSocket connections.
Revalidate user permissions during the connection lifecycle.


How to secure a WebSocket connection
To minimize the risk of security vulnerabilities arising with WebSockets, use the following guidelines:

Use the wss:// protocol (WebSockets over TLS).
Hard code the URL of the WebSockets endpoint, and certainly don't incorporate user-controllable data into this URL.
Protect the WebSocket handshake message against CSRF, to avoid cross-site WebSockets hijacking vulnerabilities.
Treat data received via the WebSocket as untrusted in both directions. Handle data safely on both the server and client ends, to prevent input-based vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting.
